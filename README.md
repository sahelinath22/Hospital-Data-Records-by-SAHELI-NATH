Project Title 

🏥 Hospital Data Records Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing data analysis on hospital data records using PostgreSQL.

The main objective of this SQL assignment is to explore and analyze hospital-related data such as patient admissions, doctor availability, department performance, and medical expenses to extract meaningful insights through SQL queries.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for real-world healthcare data analysis to assist in better decision-making and operational management.



🧩 Dataset Structure

The dataset represents hospital operational records containing data on hospitals, departments, patients, and medical expenses.

Column Name	Description

Hospital_Name	Name of the hospital
Location	City or location of the hospital
Department	Medical department (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics)
Doctors_Count	Total number of doctors available
Patients_Count	Total number of patients treated
Admission_Date	Date of patient admission
Discharge_Date	Date of patient discharge
Medical_Expenses	Total medical cost incurred for treatment



🧠 Objectives


1) Create a hospital data table and import the dataset into PostgreSQL.

2) Use SQL queries to perform data analysis and extract useful patterns.

3) Derive hospital-wise, department-wise, and city-wise insights.

4) Analyze trends in medical expenses, patient admissions, and doctor availability.

5) Demonstrate the use of aggregate functions, date functions, and grouping techniques.




🧾 SQL File Description


File Name: HOSPITAL DATA RECORDS BY SAHELI NATH.sql

The SQL file includes:

1) Table Creation Script – Defines table structure and data types.

2) Exploratory Queries – Fetches and views data records.

3) Aggregate Queries – Computes totals, averages, and sums.

4) Date-Based Analysis – Uses date functions to calculate stay durations and monthly expenses.

5) Ranking Queries – Identifies top or least performing hospitals and departments.




📊 Key Insights Derived



✅Total number of patients across all hospitals.

✅Average number of doctors available per hospital.

✅Top 3 departments with the highest number of patients.

✅Hospital with the highest total medical expenses.

✅Average medical expenses per hospital.

✅Patient with the longest stay duration.

✅City-wise total number of patients treated.

✅Department-wise average stay duration of patients.

✅Department with the least patient count.

✅Month-wise total medical expenses across all hospitals.




🧰 Tools & Technologies Used


1) PostgreSQL – For creating and querying hospital data

2) SQL – For performing data manipulation and analysis

3) CSV/Excel File – Source data for hospital records

4) pgAdmin – For executing SQL queries and visualizing results

🚀 How to Run the Project


1) Install PostgreSQL and open pgAdmin (or any SQL IDE).

2) Create a new database (e.g., HospitalData).

3) Copy and execute the SQL commands from the provided .sql file.

4) Optionally, import the CSV file into the table for data validation.

5) Run each query sequentially to explore different analytical results.




🧩 Learning Outcomes

👉🏻Understanding of aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT().

👉🏻Application of date functions for duration and time-based analysis.

👉🏻Ability to extract insights from real-world hospital datasets.

👉🏻Improved analytical thinking and query optimization skills.
